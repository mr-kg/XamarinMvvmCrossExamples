# Xamarin MVVMCross & SignalR Examples

A small repository showcasing patterns employed in order to create various types of Xamarin applications, using MVVMCross.

The main focus here is to highlight a sustainable approach to writing cross-platform applications in Xamarin Forms and Xamarin Native, whilst maximizing code reuse.

NOTE: The SignalR SimpleChat project is written in .NET Core 2.1 - please install the latest SDK (https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows)

When running the SignalR SimpleChat project, you will get a random port number on localhost - be sure to update the connection URL in SignalRViewModel. This will enable the application to access the SignalR feed from the ChatHub in the SimpleChat project.
